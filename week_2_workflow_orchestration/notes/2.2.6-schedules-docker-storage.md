# 2.2.6 - Schedules & Docker Storage with Infrastructure

## Scheduling Flows
Go to our ETL deployment in the UI: http://localhost:4200/deployments
- Hit Schedule > Add
    - We can add Interval:
        - Could be every x [minutes/hours/days]
        - Choose start date and timezone
    - Can also use Cron or RRule
        - RRules (recurring rules) are complex so they can only be done from Python code
        - Like google calendar schedules.
- Can edit this schedule too

Creating a deployment:
- Run `prefect deployment build flows/03_deployments/parameterized_flow.py:etl_parent_flow -n etl2 --cron "0 0 * * *" -a`
    - This calls the script from the last chapter and calls the proper @flow function
    - Names it 'etl2'
    - Specifies a cron of "0 0 * * *" for everday at 00:00 (midnight)
    - Applies immediately
- `prefect deployment build --help` can show us more about timezones and types of schedules

Can also apply schedule on already create deployment
- Run `prefect deployment --help` shows we can do this with the `--set-schedule` option
- Just need agents and Prefect Orion (or Prefect Cloud) running

## Docker Containers
We can store flow code basically anywhere (e.g. GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, AWS S3, GCS GCP, Azure BlobStorage)
- We will store it in a docker image and store it on Docker hub
    - Multiple ways to run Docker containers, such as calling code from containers
    - But here, we want to back in the Python version, pip packages and code right into the containers

Make a [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile)
- Use the prefect base image (prefecthq/prefect) which actually uses Python slim
- Use version `2.7.7-python3.9`
- Make a copy of the requirements.txt file, docker-requirement.txt file and copy it in the Dockerfile
    - Remove what you don't need - especially the prefect package as it is already installed
- Install the requirements with `RUN pip install -r docker-requirements.txt --trusted-host pypi.python.org --no-cache-dir`
- Copy the local flows folder to `/opt/prefect/flows` and the data folder to `/opt/prefect/flows`

Sign into Docker hub then build the image with `docker image build -t <Docker username>/prefect:zoom .`
- Now want to push to Docker hub. Run `docker login` in CLI
    - Run `docker push <Docker username>/prefect:zoom`

Now have to make **Docker Block** in Prefect UI: http://localhost:4200/blocks
- Add Block > Docker Container
    - Name it something like `zoom`
    - Can set up environment variable and the like here
        - HOWEVER, this takes longer as it will happen at runtime each time, instead of using the image directly
    - Specify the docker image we just made - otherwise it will use the base Prefect image
    - ImagePullPolicy is kind of convoluted. Set to `ALWAYS`
    - Set network
    - Set 'Auto Remove' so container is removed on completion
        - Need to remove Prefect caching from script in this case
    - Hit 'Create'
- Copy the code from the completed code page
- Can see example block creation code from [make_docker_block.py](../blocks/make_docker_block.py)

## Create Deployment from Python
Make [docker_deploy.py](../flows/03_deployments/docker_deploy.py)
- Paste in the copied code. 
    - Also import:
        - Deployment from `prefect.deployment`
        - Import `etl_parent_flow` from `parameterized_flow`
- Call `docker_dep.apply()`
- Create new Deployment with `Deployment.build_from_flow()`
    - Specify the flow is `etl_parent_flow` and the infrastructure is the docker block variable
- Run `python flows/03_deployments/docker_deploy.py` 

Should see the Deployments in the Prefect UI now: http://localhost:4200/deployments

If we type `prefect profile ls` in the CLI we will see Prefect profiles. The default prefect comes installed
- We have been using the local, **ephemeral** API
- Instead we should specify we want to use an API endpoint at a specific URL
- This is the `prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api` line that comes up when we launch prefect orion
    - Can also specify other URLs, such as for Prefect Cloud and specify different profiles
- This specifies which Prefect instance to use when running code in the CLI

Now let's launch the agent in another terminal with `prefect agent start -q default` so it uses the URL we set
- Now we can run our flow with `prefect deployment run etl-parent-flow/docker_flow -p "months=[1,2]"`
    - Can get the name from Prefect UI > Deployments if we forget
    - Set months 1 and 2 as parameters for now
- This won't just run in a Python subprocess in the agent, but in a Docker container
    - This will just be one container for the parent flow however
- Watch in Prefect UI > Deployments and look at the flow runs
