# 2.2.1 - Introduction to Workflow orchestration

**Workflow orchestration**: "Governing your dataflow in a way that respects orchestration rules and your business logic"

**Data flow**: Binds otherwise disparate set of applications together

A workflow orchestration tool lets you turn any code into a workflow you can schedule, run and observe.

## Online Shopping Analogy

Each order in a shopping cart is like a **workflow**
- Each delivery is a workflow run
- Easy to add to cart just like adding functions to workflow with just Python decorators
- Within each order you might have several boxes
    - Each box is a **task** in your workflow
    - Can be various forms/flavors/shapes
        - Can be data transformation with DBT, data cleansing with Pandas, ML usecase, etc 
- Each product may also come from different vendors
- Boxes can be as big or small as needed
    - Script size etc
- Can be delivered to multiple places
    - Can ingest data to wherever you want generally

**Work flow configuration** is like the delivery type
- At checkout, can choose if you get the order all at once or sequentially
    - Order of execution of tasks
- Can choose if delivery should be gift wrapped
    - Should it be packaged into a subprocess, a container or Kubernetes job
- Express delivery
    - Like Spark or Dask
- Speed up single core vs multiple trucks
    - Parallelization

**Workflow orchestration** is like the delivery
- Packaged as desired
- Shipped on the schedule you want
- Right delivery type
- Should scale and be highly available
    - Sick supplier or weather should not affect delivery
- Some boxes may get damaged and need to be returned
    - Workflows/tasks can be repackaged as needed
- Shipment updates and ETAs, successful shipments
    - Should be able to rely on the execution visibility and logs
- Delivery service should respect privacy and operate just on shipped address, shipment type, shipment date 
    - Just working on metadata, not knowing what the data or code is

## Core Features of Workflow Orchestration
- Remote exectuion
- Scheduling
- Retries
- Caching
- Integration with external servics
- Ad-hoc runs
- Parameterization
- Alerting you when something fails

## Different type of workflow tools

- We can see there are many Orchestration tools - we are using Prefect
- Several tools have additional features like orchestration
    - Snowflake has support for data pipelines
    - This only works within Snowflake though
- Workflow orchestration tool should be tool agnostic

## Prefect
Modern orchestration tool 
- Gives all the perks listed
- Open-source, ongoing development
