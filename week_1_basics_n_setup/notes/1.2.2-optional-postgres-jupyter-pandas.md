# 1.2.2 (Optional) - Connecting to Postgres with Jupyter and Pandas

Alternate method only if you had problems with pgcli. Open [pg-test-connection.ipynb](../2_docker_sql/pg-test-connection.ipynb).
- Notebook loads pandas and connects to the DB
- Reads first 100 rows and does preprocessing

Connecting to DB:
- Command is `engine = create_engine('postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi')`
- URI is `username:password@host_name:port/db_name`

Applying SQL:
- `pd.read_sql()` is how we apply a query to Postgres
- E.g:
    ```
    query = """
    SELECT 1 as number;
    """

    pd.read_sql(query, con=engine)
    ```

Postgres `\dt` is ran with:
- ```
    SELECT *
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables
    WHERE schemaname != 'pg_catalog' AND 
        schemaname != 'information_schema';
    ```

Can add data from dataframe directly with `df.to_sql()`
- `df.to_sql(name='yellow_tripdata_trip', con=engine, index=False)`

When we SELECT data, it is returned as a Dataframe
