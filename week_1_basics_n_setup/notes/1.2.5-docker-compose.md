# 1.2.5 - Running Postgres and pgAdmin with Docker-Compose

Recall: We ran pgAdmin, Postgres Docker containers in separate Docker containers, and had to configure a Docker network
- Will use **Docker Compose** to define and handle this once

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) allows you to make a single configuration file for multiple containers and connections
- Allows you to bring it up with just a `docker-compose.yaml` file and running `docker-compose.yml`
- Comes installed automatically when you install Docker on Windows and Mac
    - On Linux you have to install the [Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) as well

Create or look at [../2_docker_sql/docker-compose.yaml](../2_docker_sql/docker-compose.yaml)
- Start with the `services` entry, where each below is one container you want to run
    - Start with `pgdatabase`, the name we will give our Postgres container
        - Specify image as `postgres:13`
        - Add environment variables as a yaml list
        - Volume mappings are also a yaml list
            - Specify read and write by adding ":rw" to the end of the mapping string
        - Map the port
    - For pgAdmin, `pgadmin`` is fine
        - Specify image as `dpage/pgadmin4`
        - Specify environment variables and ports
        - Normally would need volumes, but we won't right now
- Don't need to specify network, when we run this it will happen automatically.

Close the containers and make sure nothing is running.
- Bring up the environment with `docker-compose up`
- Log back into pgAdmin 
    - We did not persist the state/volume, so we have to sign in again and make the servers again
- Check the DB to make sure the data is there

Can close the setup gracefully with `Ctrl+C`
- Hit `Ctrl+C` again to force close

Can run in detached mode with `docker-compose up -d`.
