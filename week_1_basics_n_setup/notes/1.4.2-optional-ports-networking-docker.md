# 1.4.2 - Port Mapping and Networks in Docker (Bonus)

Example network situation:
- Host VM (Ubuntu):
    - On Docker-compose network:
        - Postgres Database container (port 5432 open)
        - pgAdmin container (port 8080 open) (connects to the database)
    - Ports on host VM. Allows connection from localhost:
        - 5432 maps to Postgres container
        - 8080 maps to pgAdmin container
    - pgcli on VM connects to Postgres via localhost:5432
        - `pgcli -h localhost` (port defaults to 5432)

Say we have another Postgres instance running directly on the host VM, using port 5432
- When we open the Postgres container, open it on port 5431 now (adjust docker-compose.yaml)
    - When running pgcli, we need to connect with port 5431
        - `pgcli -h localhost -p 5431`

We want to use our ingestion Docker image to ingest the data to our DB automatically.
- Build from [dockerfile](../2_docker_sql/Dockerfile) with `docker build -t taxi_ingest:v001 .`
    - Fails, as it checks the entire folder, but the Postgres container uses the `ny_taxi_postgres_data` folder, and Docker looks at every subfolder to build
    - This fails because Linux has stricter
    - To fix this, do:
        - Do `mkdir data` and `sudo rm -rf ny_taxi_postgres_data data`
        - Make `.dockerignore` in the same directory and add 'data'
        - Adjust the docker-compose file and adjust where the Postgres container saves data
- Bring the database back up with `docker-compose up`
    - Run `docker ps` and you will see the Postgres container is now connected to port 5431
    - If your run `pgcli -h localhost -p 5431 -U root` it will work there now
    - It will fail when using 5432
- Run the docker image with:
```bash
URL="https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz"

docker run -it \
  --network=2_docker_sql_default \
  taxi_ingest:v001 \
    --user=root \
    --password=root \
    --host=pgdatabase \
    --port=5431 \
    --db=ny_taxi \
    --table_name=yellow_taxi_trips \
    --url=${URL}
```
- Note that we adjusted the network and host names and port as per the Docker compose file
- This will FAIL, as the ingestion script is INSIDE the docker network, 5431 is only mapped in the host machine
    - Need to use port 5432 to connect to the Postgres DB
-
