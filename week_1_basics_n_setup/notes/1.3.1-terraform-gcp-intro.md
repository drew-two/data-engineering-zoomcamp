# 1.3.1 - Introduction to Terraform Concepts & GCP Pre-Requisites

## Terraform
What is terraform?
- Open-source tool by Hashicorp for multi cloud IaC
- Supports DevOps best practices of r change management
- Managest confiugration in source control to maintain an ideal provisioning state for testing adn production environments
What is IaC?
- Infrastructure-as-Code
- Build, change, manage infrastructure in safe, consistent and repeatable way to define resource configurations you can version, resuse and share
Some advantages
- Infrastructure lifecycle management
- Very useful for stack-based deployments, and with cloud providers
- State-based approach to track resource changes throughout developments

## GCP
Google Cloud Platform, 300 USD credits for new accounts
1. Create account with Google email ID
2. Set up [new project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate), e.g. "DTC DE Course", note down "Project ID"
    - Click Your project by the search bar
    - Make new
    - Call something like dtc-de - has to be unique among all GCP projects
        - My project is **dtc-de-377105**
    - Switch to project
3. Setup service account and authentication for this projects and download auth-keys
    - Go to ["IAM and Admin"](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam)
    - Click "Service accounts" in the leftside bar
        - Credentials for services or code instead of a user
        - Should be given **least permission necessary*
    - Hit "Create Service Account" at the top
        - Name something like 'dtc-de-user'
            - Email is **dtc-de-user@dtc-de-377105.iam.gserviceaccount.com**
        - Hit Next
    - Give the Basic > Viewer role for now. Hit Next
    - Do not need to give users. Useful for multi-user environment with roles for many users
    - Hit Done.
    - Hit the 3 dots on the account, and then hit Add Key > Create New Key
        - Download the key
4. Download SDK for local setup
    - Check with `gcloud -v`
    - Otherwise go the [Docs page](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart) to download
        - Download with `curl -O https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-cli-416.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
        - Put somewhere like home directory and run `tar -xf google-cloud-cli-416.0.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
        - Install with `./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh`
        - Open new terminal
        - Initialize with `./google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud init`
5. Set environment variable to point to your downloaded GCP auth-keys:
    - Move service account key to somewhere like `~/.config/gcloud/`
    - Export key location with `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="~/google-cloud-sdk/<key.json>`
    - Run `gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <project ID>`
        - May need to run `gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <project ID>`
    - This will redirect to a browser link. Choose the email you are using for GCP
    - This is **Oauth** authentication. Other way does not involve browser

## Create infrastructure for our project with Terraform

### Modules in GCP
- Google Cloud Storage (GCS): Data Lake
    - Like an S3 bucket (flat file system)
    - Data Lake is a way to store raw data in organized fashion
        - More directories and compressed with other file types (e.g. parquet)
- BigQuery: Data Warehouse
    - Data is modelled into more structure with tables

### Setup Access
Add the service roles for the modules
1. Go back to [IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam)
2. Edit the service account we just created
    - Edit and the following roles:
        - Storage Admin
            - Full control of ECS
        - Storage Object Admin
            - Full control of ECS objects
        - BigQuery Admin
            - Adminster all BigQuery Resources and Data
    - NOT recommended for production - would use the minimum permissions needed for the minimum resources needed
        - You would be making custom roles
    - Save.

### Enable APIs
Need to enable APIs so you can interact from code or CLI
1. Go to [APIs & Services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard)
2. Hit + Enable APIs and Services
3. MAKE SURE you are on the right project
4. Add the following:
    - General [Identity and Access Management (IAM) API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iam.googleapis.com)
    - The [IAM Service Account Credentials API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iamcredentials.googleapis.com)

### Execution

Run again if needed:
- `gcloud auth application-default login`

Initalize state file (.tfstate) in the directory with the .tf files
- `terraform init`
