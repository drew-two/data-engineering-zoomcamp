# 1.2.6 - SQL Refreshser

Make sure you have `taxi+_zone_lookup.csv` loaded to the DB and that `zones` has 265 entries.
- Open up the SQL Tool and look at this DB

Seeing first 100 rows:
```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    taxi
LIMIT 100;
```

Addressing multiple tables (JOIN):
```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t,
    zones zpu,
    zones zdo
WHERE
    t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID" AND
    t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;
```
- Can have arbitrary number of tables and 

Concatenating from multiple tables (CONCAT): 
```sql
SELECT
    t."tpep_pickup_datetime",
	t."tpep_dropoff_datetime",
	total_amount,
	CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' / ', zpu."Zone") AS "pick_up_loc",
	CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' / ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t,
    zones zpu,
    zones zdo
WHERE
    t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID" AND
    t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;
```

Pulling FROM a single table via JOINs (no WHERE):
```sql
SELECT
    t."tpep_pickup_datetime",
	t."tpep_dropoff_datetime",
	total_amount,
	CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' / ', zpu."Zone") AS "pick_up_loc",
	CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' / ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t JOIN zones zpu
		ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
    JOIN zones zdo
		ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
WHERE
    t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID" AND
    t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;
```

Get everything where a value is missing (NULL):
```sql
SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
	tpep_dropoff_datetime,
	total_amount,
	"PULocationID",
	"DOLocationID"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t
WHERE 
	"DOLocationID" is NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

Getting a value where its missing in another table (NOT IN):
```sql
SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
	tpep_dropoff_datetime,
	total_amount,
	"PULocationID",
	"DOLocationID"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t
WHERE 
	"DOLocationID" NOT IN (
		SELECT "LocationID" FROM zones)
LIMIT 100;
```

Deleting specific row given index (DELETE FROM):
```sql
DELETE FROM zones WHERE "LocationID" = 142;
```

Seeing something that is in the Left table (first one) but not in the right (LEFT JOIN):
```sql
SELECT
    t."tpep_pickup_datetime",
	t."tpep_dropoff_datetime",
	total_amount,
	CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' / ', zpu."Zone") AS "pick_up_loc",
	CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' / ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t LEFT JOIN zones zpu
		ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
    JOIN zones zdo
		ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;
```

Seeing all the values when they are missing in just any one table (OUTER JOIN):
```sql
SELECT
    t."tpep_pickup_datetime",
	t."tpep_dropoff_datetime",
	total_amount,
	CONCAT(zpu."Borough", ' / ', zpu."Zone") AS "pick_up_loc",
	CONCAT(zdo."Borough", ' / ', zdo."Zone") AS "dropoff_loc"
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t OUTER JOIN zones zpu
		ON t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
    JOIN zones zdo
		ON t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
LIMIT 100;
```

Removing some data from timestamps (DATE_TRUNC):
```sql
SELECT
    tpep_pickup_datetime,
	tpep_dropoff_datetime,
	DATE_TRUNC('DAY', tpep_dropoff_datetime),
	total_amount
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t
WHERE 
	"DOLocationID" NOT IN (
		SELECT "LocationID" FROM zones)
LIMIT 100;
```
- NOTE: this returns a **timestamp**, not a **date**. This is a Postgres thing rather than a general SQL thing
- It also

Cast TIMESTAMP type to DATE type (CAST):
```sql
SELECT
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
	COUNT(1)
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY 
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER by "day" ASC
```
- Much more portable than DATE_TRUNC
- Shows counts for each day
- Orders by day ascending

Trips by day sorted by count (CST, ORDER BY):
```sql
SELECT
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
	COUNT(1)
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY 
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY "count" DESC;
```
- Ordered by number of rides descending

Max and Min (MAX, MIN):
```sql
SELECT
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
	COUNT(1) as "count",
	MAX(total_amount),
	MIN(passenger_count)
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY 
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE)
ORDER BY "count" DESC;
```

Grouping by multiple categories (GROUP BY 1 2)
```sql
SELECT
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
	"DOLocationID",
	COUNT(1) as "count",
	MAX(total_amount),
	MIN(passenger_count)
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY 
	1, 2
ORDER BY "count" DESC;
```

Sorting by multiple fields (ORDER BY)
```sql
SELECT
	CAST(tpep_dropoff_datetime AS DATE) as "day",
	"DOLocationID",
	COUNT(1) as "count",
	MAX(total_amount),
	MIN(passenger_count)
FROM
    yellow_taxi_data t
GROUP BY 
	1, 2
ORDER BY 
	"day" ASC,
	"DOLocationID" ASC;
```
- Group by is like the workhouse of all analytics
- Will see a variation of this a LOT
