# BigQuery Best Practices

Cost reduction
- Avoid SELECT *
    - BQ stores by column, so it is better to only call the columns you need
- Price your queries before running them
    - Price shows in the top right when highlighting SQL
- Use clustered or partitioned tables
    - See last chapter
- Use streaming inserts with caution
    - Increases cost drastically
- Materialize query results in stages
    - In case you are using CTE in multiple stages, it might make sense to materialize 
    - BQ also caches query results

Query performance
- Filter on partitioned/clustered columns
- Denormalizing data
    - If complicated structure, use nested or repeated columns
- Use external data sources appropriately
    - Might be more expensive when reading from a bucket
    - Don't use if you want higher query performance
- Reduce data before using a JOIN
- Donot treat WITH clauses as prepared statements
- Avoid oversharding tables

- Avoid Javascript user-defined functions
- Use approximate aggregation functions (HyperLogLog++)
- Order Last, for query operations to maximize performance
- Optimize your join patterns
- Place the table with the largest number of rows first, then table with the fewest rows, then place by decreasing size
    - Because if you place largest table first, it will get distributed evenly, but the second table is the one broadcasted to all the nodes
    - We will see how BQ internally handles queries and it will make this more clear
