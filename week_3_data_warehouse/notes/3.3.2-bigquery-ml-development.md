# 3.3.2 - BigQuery Machine Learning Deployment

Continuing from the [last lesson](./3.3.1-ml-bigquery.md)
- Look at the readme, [extract_model.md](../extract_model.md)
- Log in to gcloud and run the bq extract model command
    - Need to edit for your own project name and make the bucket path
    - This will take some time
- Can see the model exported to the bucket now
- Now make directory `/tmp/model/` and copy the bucket into the directory

Now to serve the mode:
- Make a serving directory `./serving_dir/tip_model/`
- Copy the model into it
- Now we will pull the docker image `tensorflow/serving` and run it with this model
- Run commnand:
    ```
    docker run -p 8501:8501 \
       --mount type=bind,source=`pwd`/serving_dir/tip_model,target=/models/tip_model \
       -e MODEL_NAME=tip_model \
       -t tensorflow/serving \
       &
    ```
    - Open to port 8501
    - Bind the directory with the model to `/models/tip_model` in the container
    - Env variable `MODEL_NAME` with value 'tip_model'
    - Allocates terminal
- Can check if it is running with `docker ps`

Can test with Postman or run the curl command
- Curl command predicts with a test example
- Should return a JSON with "predictions" with a list of results, just one and a float ~0.25
- Can also just look at the URL: http://localhost:8501/v1/models/tip_model for healthcheck
