# 4.2.1 - Start Your dbt Project: BigQuery and dbt Cloud (Alternative A)

## Setup

1. Create a git repository from scratch, something like ny_taxi_rides_zoomcamp
    - Keep this for adding to dbt
    - Should look like `week_4_analytics_engineering/taxi_rides_ny/` when we are done

2. Follow the instructions in [README.md](../README.md#setting-up-dbt-for-using-postgres-locally-alternative-b) to set up dbt Cloud with BiqQuery.
    - Use the Git repo we made in step 1
    - Go to the web-based IDE and make sure the Git repo is connected

3. In BiqQuery, there should now be a new dataset `trips_data_all`
    - Add the green and yellow tripdata as tables `green_tripdata` and `yellow_tripdata` respectively.
    - Create datasets:
        - dbt_[first_initial][last_name]
        - staging
        - production

4. Back in the dbt cloud IDE:
    - Click the 'Initialize dbt project' button
        - Note that the .gitignore is automatically updated
    - The button now says 'Commit and Sync'; click it and do so
    - It now says 'Create Branch'; do so, name it something like 'dbt-zoomcamp'
    - You should now be able to edit

## Editing dbt

Edit project manifest: `dbt_project.yml`
- Rename project. Something like `taxi_rides_ny`
- Leave the rest blank.
- Notice the paths section. These are straightforward
- Go down to models; rename model. Something like `taxi_rides_ny`
    - Delete the entries under the model

We will be storing models in `models/`
- Some example models with basic DAG
- Will be using this later, we will create our own models.
