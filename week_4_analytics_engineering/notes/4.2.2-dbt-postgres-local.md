# 4.2.2 - Start Your dbt Project: Postgres and dbt Core Locally (Alternative B)

1. Create a git repository from scratch, something like ny_taxi_rides_zoomcamp
    - Keep this for adding to dbt
    - Should look like `week_4_analytics_engineering/taxi_rides_ny/` when we are done

2. Follow the instructions in [README.md](../README.md#setting-up-dbt-for-using-bigquery-alternative-a---preferred) to set up dbt Cloud with BiqQuery.
    - To install with pip, in the course conda environment run `pip install dbt-postgres`
    - Otherwise, with docker follow instructions in the different, Docker specific [docker_setup/README.md](../docker_setup/README.md)
        - Based on Debian. Slower than using pip and somewhat slower than running Docker on Debian system
    - When editing [profiles.yml](~/.dbt/profiles.yml):
        - Use the GCP project ID for this project and the 

3. Open a postgres local instance, could be like how we did in week 1
    - In the local Postgres environment, add the database 'production'
        - Add the following schemas:
            - 'dbt_[first_initial][last_name]' for models
            - 'staging'
            - 'trips_data_all' with the yellow and green datasets loaded for 2019/2020

4. Create the file [profiles.yml](~/.dbt/profiles.yml)
    - Add an entry for your local Postgres called 'pg-dbt-workshop'
        ```
        pg-dbt-workshop:
          target: dev
          outputs:
            dev:
              type: postgres
              host: localhost
              user: [user]
              password: [password]
              port: 5432
              dbname: production
              schema: dbt_[first_initial][last_name]
              threads: 4
              keepalives_idle: 0
        ```
    - Can also have multiple profiles, e.g. for dev and staging

5. Initialize the dbt repository. Can skip if already done with Docker.
    - Make project under `dbt_local` or the git repository by running `dbt init`
    - Go to the dbt_project.yml file and change the profile name to 'pg-dbt-workshop'
